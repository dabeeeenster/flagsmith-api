# Flagsmith REST API

## Development Environment

Before running the application, you'll need to configure a database for the application. The steps 
to do this can be found in the following section entitled 'Databases'.  

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python src/manage.py migrate
python src/manage.py runserver
```

The application can also be run locally using Docker Compose if required, however, it's beneficial 
to run locally using the above steps as it gives you hot reloading. To run using docker compose, 
simply run the following command from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Databases

Databases are configured in app/settings/\<env\>.py

The app is configured to use PostgreSQL for all environments.

When running locally, you'll need a local instance of postgres running. The easiest way to do this 
is to use docker which is achievable with the following command:

```docker run --name local_postgres -d -P postgres```

You'll also need to ensure that you have a value for POSTGRES_PASSWORD set as an environment 
variable on your development machine.

When running on a Heroku-ish platform, the application reads the database connection in production 
from an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`. This should be configured in the Heroku-ish 
application configuration.

When running the application using Docker, it reads the database configuration from the settings 
located in `app.settings.production`

## Initialising

### Locally

The application is built using django which comes with a handy set of admin pages available at 
`/admin/`. To access these, you'll need to create a super user. This can be done with the following
command:

```bash
python src/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once you've created the super user, you can use the details to log in at `/admin/`. From here, you 
can create an organisation and either create another user or simply assign the organisation to your
admin user to begin using the application.

### In a Heroku-ish environment

Once the app has been deployed, you can initialise it to create a super user by sending a GET request 
to  the `/api/v1/users/init/` endpoint. This will create a super user with the details configured in 
`app.settings.common` with the following parameters:

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME,
ADMIN_EMAIL,
ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD
```

Note that this functionality can be turned off in the settings if required by setting 
`ALLOW_ADMIN_INITIATION_VIA_URL=False`.

## Deploying

### Using Heroku-ish Platform (e.g. Heroku, Dokku, Flynn)

The application should run on any Heroku-ish platform (e.g. Dokku, Flynn) by simply adding the 
required git repo and pushing the code. The code for running the app is contained in the Procfile.

To get it running, you'll need to add the necessary config variables as outlined below.

### Using ElasticBeanstalk

The application will run within ElasticBeanstalk using the default Python setup.
We've included the .ebextensions/ and .elasticbeanstalk/ directories which will run on ElasticBeanstalk.

The changes required to run in your environment will be as follows

`.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` - update application_name and default_region to the relevant variables for your setup.

`.ebextensions/options.config` - within the root of the project `generate.sh` will add in all environment variables that are required using your chosen CI/CD. Alternatively, you can add your own `options.config`.

### Using Docker

If you want to run the entire Flagsmith platform, including the front end dashboard, take a look at
our [Flagsmith Docker repository](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-docker).

The application can be configured to run using docker with simply by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will use some default settings created in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the root of 
the project. These should be changed before using in any production environments.

You can work on the project itself using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This gets an environment up and running along with Postgres and enables hot reloading etc.

The docker container also accepts an argument that sets the access log file location for gunicorn. By default 
this is set to /dev/null to maintain the default behaviour of gunicorn. It can either be set to `"-"` to redirect
the logs to stdout or to a location on the file system as required.

### Environment Variables

The application relies on the following environment variables to run:

#### Database Environment Variables

* `DATABASE_URL`: required by develop and master environments, should be a standard format database url e.g. postgres://user:password@host:port/db_name

You can also provide individual variables as below. Note that if a `DATABASE_URL` is defined, it will take precedent and the below variables will be ignored.

* `DJANGO_DB_HOST`: Database hostname
* `DJANGO_DB_NAME`: Database name
* `DJANGO_DB_USER`: Database username
* `DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
* `DJANGO_DB_PORT`: Database port

#### Application Environment Variables

* `ENV`: string representing the current running environment, e.g. 'local', 'dev', 'prod'. Defaults to 'local'
* `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: secret key required by Django, if one isn't provided one will be created using `django.core.management.utilsget_random_secret_key`
* `LOG_LEVEL`: DJANGO logging level. Can be one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`
* `ACCESS_LOG_LOCATION`: The location to store web logs generated by gunicorn if running as a Docker container. If not set, no logs will be stored. If set to `-` the logs will be sent to `stdout`.
* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: comma separated list of hosts the application will run on in the given environment
* `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: comma separated list of hosts to allow unsafe (POST, PUT) requests from. Useful for allowing localhost to set traits in development.
* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: python path to settings file for the given environment, e.g. "app.settings.develop"
* `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY`: if google analytics is required, add your tracking code
* `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: service account json for accessing the google API, used for getting usage of an organisation - needs access to analytics.readonly scope
* `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`: If you want to send API events to InfluxDB, specify this write token.
* `INFLUXDB_URL`: The URL for your InfluxDB database
* `INFLUXDB_ORG`: The organisation string for your InfluxDB API call.
* `GA_TABLE_ID`: GA table ID (view) to query when looking for organisation usage
* `ALLOWED_ADMIN_IP_ADDRESSES`: restrict access to the django admin console to a comma separated list of IP addresses (e.g. `127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2`) 
* `USER_CREATE_PERMISSIONS`: set the permissions for creating new users, using a comma separated list of djoser or rest_framework permissions. Use this to turn off public user creation for self hosting. e.g. `'djoser.permissions.CurrentUserOrAdmin'` Defaults to `'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny'`.
* `ENABLE_EMAIL_ACTIVATION`: new user registration will go via email activation flow, default False
* `SENTRY_SDK_DSN`: If using Sentry, set the project DSN here.
* `SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE`: Float. If using Sentry, sets the trace sample rate. Defaults to 1.0.
* `DEFAULT_ORG_STORE_TRAITS_VALUE`: Boolean. Set this flag to ensure new organisations default to not persisting traits. Useful for data sensitive installations that don't want persistent traits.

#### Email Environment Variables

* `SENDER_EMAIL`: Email address from which emails are sent
* `EMAIL_BACKEND`: One of:
  * `django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend`
  * `sgbackend.SendGridBackend`
  * `django_ses.SESBackend`

If using `django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend` you will need to configure:

* `EMAIL_HOST` = env("EMAIL_HOST", default='localhost')
* `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = env("EMAIL_HOST_USER", default=None)
* `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` = env("EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD", default=None)
* `EMAIL_PORT` = env("EMAIL_PORT", default=587)
* `EMAIL_USE_TLS` = env.bool("EMAIL_USE_TLS", default=True)

If using `sgbackend.SendGridBackend` you will need to configure:

* `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: API key for the Sendgrid account

If using AWS SES you will need to configure:

* `AWS_SES_REGION_NAME`: If using Amazon SES as the email provider, specify the region (e.g. eu-central-1) that contains your verified sender e-mail address. Defaults to us-east-1
* `AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT`: ses region endpoint, e.g. email.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com. Required when using ses in a region other than us-east-1
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: If using Amazon SES, these form part of your SES credentials.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: If using Amazon SES, these form part of your SES credentials.

### API Telemetry

Flagsmith collects information about self hosted installations. This helps us understand how the platform is being used. This data is *never* shared outside of the organisation, and is anonymous by design. You can opt out of sending this telemetry on startup by setting the `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `False`.

We collect the following data on startup per API server instance:

* Total number of Organisations
* Total number of Projects
* Total number of Environments
* Total number of Features
* Total number of Segments
* Total number of Users
* DEBUG django variable
* ENV django variable
* API server external IP address

### Creating a secret key

It is important to also set an environment variable on whatever platform you are using for 
`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`. There is a function to create one in `app.settings.common` if none exists in 
the environment variables, however, this is not suitable for use in production. To generate a new 
secret key, you can use the function defined in `src/secret-key-gen.py` by simply running it from a 
command prompt:

```bash
python secret-key-gen.py
```

## Pre commit

The application uses pre-commit configuration ( `.pre-commit-config.yaml` ) to run black formatting before commits.

To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

You can manually run the black formatter with:

```bash
python -m black src
```

## Adding dependencies

To add a python dependency, add it to requirements.txt / requirements-dev.txt with it's current version number. 

## Caching

The application makes use of caching in a couple of locations:

1. Environment authentication - the application utilises an in memory cache for the environment object 
on all endpoints that use the X-Environment-Key header. 
2. Environment flags - the application utilises an in memory cache for the flags returned when calling 
/flags. The number of seconds this is cached for is configurable using the environment variable 
`"CACHE_FLAGS_SECONDS"`
3. Project Segments - the application utilises an in memory cache for returning the segments for a 
given project. The number of seconds this is cached for is configurable using the environment variable
`"CACHE_PROJECT_SEGMENTS_SECONDS"`.
